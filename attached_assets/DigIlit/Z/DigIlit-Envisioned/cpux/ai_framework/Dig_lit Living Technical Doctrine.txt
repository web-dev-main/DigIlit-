Dig|lit Living Technical Doctrine The Adaptive Brain: Technology-Agnostic Architecture Principles "Tools change every decade. Principles endure for centuries." This document transcends React, Python, and cloud providers—it defines HOW we think about technology. COMMANDMENT I: ARCHITECTURAL FIRST PRINCIPLES 1.1 Own Your Data Layer (Forever) Principle: Never build on a platform where data export requires permission or proprietary formats. Enforcement: Every database must support standard SQL or NoSQL export (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) Binary blobs stored with open codecs (AVIF/WebP, not proprietary) APIs must provide bulk export endpoints (CSV, JSON, Parquet) Examples: ✅ Good: Supabase (PostgreSQL), self-hosted Minio (S3-compatible) ❌ Bad: Salesforce proprietary database, Notion API (no bulk export) Why It Lasts 100 Years: In 2075, PostgreSQL may be obsolete, but the principle of ownable data survives. Whatever replaces SQL will still need export portability. 1.2 Abstraction Layers Are Mandatory Principle: Never couple business logic directly to infrastructure. Always have a translation layer. Implementation: ┌─────────────────────┐ │ BUSINESS LOGIC │ ← Pure functions, no vendor references └──────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ │ ABSTRACTION LAYER │ ← Interfaces/protocols └──────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌─────┴─────┐ ▼ ▼ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ AWS S3 │ │ Vercel │ ← Swappable providers └─────────┘ └─────────┘ Code Example (Storage Abstraction): // GOOD: Provider-agnostic interface interface StorageProvider { upload(file: File, path: string): Promise<URL>; download(path: string): Promise<Blob>; delete(path: string): Promise<void>; } // Implementations can swap without touching business logic class S3Storage implements StorageProvider { ... } class CloudflareR2Storage implements StorageProvider { ... } class LocalFileStorage implements StorageProvider { ... } // Business logic never knows which provider is active const storage: StorageProvider = getConfiguredStorage(); await storage.upload(userAvatar, '/avatars/user-123.jpg'); Why It Lasts 100 Years: Interfaces outlive implementations. When AWS is replaced by quantum storage in 2070, we swap the implementation—business logic untouched. 1.3 Security by Default, Not by Addition Principle: Security cannot be "added later." It's foundational, like a building's structure. Non-Negotiable Layers: Authentication: Multi-factor by default (TOTP, WebAuthn) Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) + attribute-based (ABAC) Encryption: At rest: AES-256-GCM minimum In transit: TLS 1.3+ only In use: Homomorphic encryption for sensitive compute (future-ready) Zero Trust: Every request authenticated, even internal services Quantum Resistance: Prepare for post-quantum cryptography (NIST standards) Threat Model Hierarchy: Level 1: Script kiddies → Rate limiting, CAPTCHA Level 2: Professional hackers → WAF, intrusion detection Level 3: Nation-state actors → Air-gapped secrets, hardware security modules Level 4: Insider threats → Audit logs, least-privilege access Level 5: AI-powered attacks → Adversarial ML defenses (future) Why It Lasts 100 Years: Attackers get smarter, but defense-in-depth is eternal. Quantum computers may break RSA, but the principle of layered security survives. 1.4 Performance is a Feature, Not an Optimization Principle: Slow software is broken software. Performance budgets are requirements, not goals. Immutable Performance Targets: Metric Target Rationale Time to First Byte (TTFB) <200ms Human perception threshold Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5s Google Core Web Vitals API Response (p99) <500ms Keep users in flow state Database Query (p99) <100ms Prevent N+1 query hell Build Time <5 min Fast feedback loops Enforcement Mechanisms: Budget Guards: CI/CD fails if bundle size exceeds thresholds Real User Monitoring: Track p50/p95/p99 latencies in production Chaos Engineering: Intentionally degrade performance to test resilience Annual Performance Audits: Third-party review by web.dev or similar Why It Lasts 100 Years: Human patience hasn't increased in 10,000 years. Even with 10Gbps internet in 2075, users will still rage-quit slow apps. 1.5 Composition Over Inheritance Principle: Build systems from small, reusable pieces. Avoid deep class hierarchies. Design Pattern: // BAD: Deep inheritance tree (fragile) class Animal { ... } class Mammal extends Animal { ... } class Dog extends Mammal { ... } class Labrador extends Dog { ... } // Now locked into 4-level hierarchy // GOOD: Composition (flexible) interface Movable { move(): void; } interface Audible { makeSound(): void; } interface Trainable { learn(trick: string): void; } class Labrador implements Movable, Audible, Trainable { // Compose behaviors as needed private locomotion = new QuadrupedMovement(); private vocalization = new BarkSound(); private cognition = new ObedienceTraining(); move() { this.locomotion.walk(); } makeSound() { this.vocalization.emit('woof'); } learn(trick: string) { this.cognition.train(trick); } } Why It Lasts 100 Years: Nature uses composition (DNA is modular). Rigid hierarchies go extinct when environments change. COMMANDMENT II: TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 2.1 The Lindy Effect Filter Rule: Prefer technologies that have survived >10 years. New tech must prove 10x better to replace old. Technology Tiers: TIER S (Immortal): SQL, HTTP, HTML, CSS, Git ↓ Use liberally, these will outlive you TIER A (Stable): PostgreSQL, Linux, Python, JavaScript ↓ Safe bets, incremental improvements TIER B (Mature): React, Docker, Kubernetes ↓ Dominant but watch for successors TIER C (Emerging): Rust, WebAssembly, Svelte ↓ Use for new projects, avoid critical path TIER D (Experimental): Deno, Bun, AI frameworks ↓ R&D only, expect rewrites Evaluation Scorecard (0-10 scale): Criterion Weight Example: Supabase Open Source 2x 10 (PostgreSQL core) Community Size 1.5x 8 (50K+ GitHub stars) Data Portability 2x 10 (standard SQL export) Security Track Record 1.5x 7 (young but no breaches) Performance 1x 9 (sub-100ms queries) Documentation 1x 10 (excellent) Vendor Lock-In Risk 2x 8 (can self-host) Total Score - 94/110 → Adopt Thresholds: 90+: Adopt immediately 70-89: Adopt with abstraction layer 50-69: Use for non-critical features <50: Avoid or sandbox only 2.2 The Boring Technology Club Manifesto: You get 3 "innovation tokens" per project. Spend them wisely. Example Budget: Project: AI-Powered ERP System Innovation Token 1: Custom AI agent architecture (core differentiation) Innovation Token 2: WebAssembly for client-side data processing (10x perf) Innovation Token 3: [SAVED FOR FUTURE] Boring Choices: - PostgreSQL for database (not MongoDB or exotic DB) - React for frontend (not bleeding-edge framework) - Docker for deployment (not Kubernetes initially) - Stripe for payments (not custom crypto contracts) Why 3 Tokens? 0 tokens: Commodity product, no competitive advantage 1-3 tokens: Differentiated but debuggable 4+ tokens: Hero project that collapses when creator leaves Why It Lasts 100 Years: The principle of "conserve innovation budget" is timeless. Even in 2075, chasing shiny objects will still cause project failures. 2.3 Open Source Contribution Mandate Policy: For every 10 hours spent using open source, contribute 1 hour back. Contribution Ladder: Novice: Report bugs with reproduction steps Contributor: Fix typos in documentation Developer: Submit bug fixes or small features Maintainer: Own a package or subsystem Creator: Launch a new open-source project (1000+ stars) Strategic Projects to Sponsor (2025-2045): Database: Fund PostgreSQL extensions for AI workloads Frontend: Contribute to React or successor framework AI: Open-source model training pipelines Security: Quantum-resistant crypto libraries DevOps: Self-healing infrastructure tools Why It Lasts 100 Years: Open source is a commons. Tragedies are avoided through reciprocity. Companies that only take eventually face forks or abandonment. COMMANDMENT III: ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS FOR LONGEVITY 3.1 The Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) Structure: ┌───────────────────────┐ │ BUSINESS LOGIC │ │ (Core Domain) │ └───────────┬───────────┘ │ ┌────────────┼────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌────▼────┐ ┌───▼────┐ ┌───▼────┐ │ Port │ │ Port │ │ Port │ (Interfaces) └────┬────┘ └───┬────┘ └───┬────┘ │ │ │ ┌────▼────┐ ┌──▼─────┐ ┌──▼──────┐ │Adapter │ │Adapter │ │ Adapter │ (Implementations) │(REST) │ │(GraphQL)│ │(gRPC) │ └─────────┘ └────────┘ └─────────┘ Benefits: Swap APIs (REST → GraphQL) without touching core logic Test business logic without databases (mock ports) Add new interfaces (CLI, WebSockets) easily Example: // CORE: Business logic (no infrastructure) class OrderService { constructor( private paymentGateway: PaymentPort, private inventory: InventoryPort, private notifications: NotificationPort ) {} async placeOrder(order: Order): Promise<OrderResult> { // Pure business logic const payment = await this.paymentGateway.charge(order.amount); await this.inventory.reserve(order.items); await this.notifications.send(order.customerEmail, 'Order confirmed'); return { orderId: payment.id, status: 'confirmed' }; } } // PORTS: Interfaces (what core needs) interface PaymentPort { charge(amount: Money): Promise<PaymentResult>; } // ADAPTERS: Implementations (how it's done) class StripeAdapter implements PaymentPort { async charge(amount: Money) { return await stripe.charges.create({ amount: amount.cents, currency: amount.currency }); } } class CryptoAdapter implements PaymentPort { async charge(amount: Money) { return await tronWeb.contract().transfer(WALLET, amount.toUSDT()); } } // ASSEMBLY: Dependency injection const service = new OrderService( new StripeAdapter(), // Can swap to CryptoAdapter without changing OrderService new SupabaseInventory(), new SendgridNotifications() ); 3.2 Event-Driven Architecture for Scale Principle: Systems communicate through events, not direct calls. Enables async, decoupling, and replay. Event Flow: USER ACTION → COMMAND → EVENT → HANDLERS → SIDE EFFECTS Example: User clicks "Buy" → PlaceOrderCommand → OrderPlacedEvent → [ReserveInventory, ChargePayment, SendEmail] → Success/Failure Events Event Store Schema: interface DomainEvent { id: string; // UUID type: string; // 'OrderPlaced', 'PaymentCharged' aggregateId: string; // Order ID, User ID, etc. data: any; // Event payload metadata: { timestamp: Date; userId: string; causationId: string; // What triggered this event correlationId: string; // Trace full transaction }; } // Store ALL events forever (immutable log) CREATE TABLE events ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY, type TEXT NOT NULL, aggregate_id TEXT NOT NULL, data JSONB NOT NULL, metadata JSONB NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() ); CREATE INDEX idx_events_aggregate ON events(aggregate_id, created_at); CREATE INDEX idx_events_type ON events(type, created_at); Why It Lasts 100 Years: Event sourcing is how the universe works (physics = events through time). Append-only logs are the most durable data structure. 3.3 Microservices? No. Modular Monolith? Yes. Philosophy: Start with a well-structured monolith. Extract microservices only when proven necessary. Monolith Structure: app/ ├── modules/ │ ├── orders/ │ │ ├── domain/ # Business logic │ │ ├── api/ # REST endpoints │ │ ├── events/ # Event handlers │ │ └── db/ # Data access │ ├── payments/ │ ├── inventory/ │ └── notifications/ ├── shared/ │ ├── auth/ │ ├── database/ │ └── config/ └── main.ts # Application entry Microservice Extraction Criteria: ✅ Module has clear bounded context (payments, search) ✅ Different scaling needs (search needs 10x compute) ✅ Team size >20 people (Conway's Law: architecture mirrors org) ✅ Regulatory isolation required (HIPAA-compliant service separate) When NOT to Extract: ❌ Premature optimization ("we might need to scale") ❌ Resume-driven development ("I want to learn Kubernetes") ❌ Cargo culting ("Netflix does microservices") 3.4 Database-Per-Service (Eventually) Evolution Path: PHASE 1 (Year 0-2): Single PostgreSQL database, multiple schemas orders_schema.orders payments_schema.transactions PHASE 2 (Year 2-5): Logical separation, still one database Strict foreign key rules: No cross-schema FKs PHASE 3 (Year 5+): Physical separation when needed orders_db.orders payments_db.transactions Communication via events, never direct DB queries Why Gradual? Distributed transactions are HARD (2PC, Sagas, eventual consistency) Network calls are 100,000x slower than memory Operational complexity explodes (monitoring, backups, migrations) Why Eventually? Scale: 1M+ transactions/sec requires sharding Compliance: GDPR right-to-erasure easier with user-specific DB Failure isolation: Payment DB crash doesn't take down search COMMANDMENT IV: TECHNICAL DEBT LEDGER 4.1 Debt is Not Evil, Untracked Debt Is Metaphor: Technical debt is like financial debt. A mortgage for a house is smart debt. Credit card debt for luxury goods is dumb debt. Debt Classification: TYPE 1: Strategic Debt (Good) - Ship MVP fast, refactor after market validation - Hardcode config initially, build admin UI later - Manual deployments → Automate after 100th deploy TYPE 2: Tactical Debt (Acceptable) - Copy-paste code to meet deadline (refactor next sprint) - Skip tests for prototype (add before production) - Use suboptimal algorithm (optimize when it's proven bottleneck) TYPE 3: Accidental Debt (Needs Repayment) - Misunderstood requirements → wrong abstraction - Technology choice didn't pan out (framework deprecated) - Team knowledge gaps (junior wrote spaghetti code) TYPE 4: Reckless Debt (FORBIDDEN) - No error handling ("it works on my machine") - Hardcoded credentials in code - SQL injection vulnerabilities - No documentation for critical systems
