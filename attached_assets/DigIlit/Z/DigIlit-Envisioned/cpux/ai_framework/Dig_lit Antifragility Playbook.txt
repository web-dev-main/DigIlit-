Dig|lit Antifragility Playbook The Survival Guide: Thrive During Black Swan Events "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger — if you've prepared for it." This document catalogs existential threats and exact protocols to survive them. PHILOSOPHY: ANTIFRAGILITY VS RESILIENCE Resilience: Withstand shocks, return to original state Antifragility: Benefit from volatility, emerge stronger Example: - Resilient company: Survives recession, recovers to pre-crisis level - Antifragile company: Gains market share during recession, 3x larger after Dig|lit is built for antifragility. PART I: THREAT CATALOG (50 Ways to Die) Category A: Technical Catastrophes A1. Total Data Loss Scenario: Database corruption + backup failure Probability: 2% per year Impact: Extinction-level Prevention Protocol: Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Rule): - 3 copies of data - 2 different media types - 1 offsite location Implementation: Primary: Supabase (PostgreSQL with point-in-time recovery) Secondary: Daily exports to AWS S3 Tertiary: Weekly exports to Google Cloud Storage Quaternary: Monthly exports to cold storage (Backblaze B2) Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 1 hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes Response Protocol: # Immediate actions (within 5 minutes) 1. Stop all write operations (prevent further corruption) 2. Notify all users of outage 3. Activate backup restoration procedure # Recovery steps 4. Restore from most recent backup 5. Verify data integrity (run checksums) 6. Test critical functions (auth, payments, orders) 7. Resume operations with monitoring # Post-mortem (within 48 hours) 8. Root cause analysis 9. Update backup procedures 10. Compensate affected customers A2. Cloud Provider Shutdown Scenario: Netlify/Supabase goes bankrupt overnight Probability: 5% over 10 years Impact: High (but survivable) Prevention Protocol: // Multi-cloud architecture (active-passive) const deploymentTargets = { primary: 'netlify', secondary: 'vercel', tertiary: 'cloudflare-pages' }; // Weekly migration test const testMigration = async () => { // 1. Export code from primary const codebase = await exportFromGit(); // 2. Deploy to secondary await deployToVercel(codebase); // 3. Verify functionality const healthy = await runSmokeTests('https://diglit-backup.vercel.app'); if (!healthy) { alert('Secondary deployment failed! Fix immediately.'); } }; schedule.weekly(testMigration); Response Protocol: Hour 0: Provider announces shutdown → Activate secondary deployment (Vercel) → Update DNS (point to new host) Hour 1: DNS propagation begins → Monitor traffic shift → Verify all features work Hour 24: Full migration complete → All users on new platform → Old platform deprecated Week 1: Post-migration → Optimize for new platform → Update documentation A3. DDoS Attack (Distributed Denial of Service) Scenario: Targeted attack, 1M requests/second Probability: 20% per year for successful companies Impact: Medium (service degradation) Prevention Protocol: Layer 1: Cloudflare (Network Layer) - 100+ Tbps capacity - Automatic DDoS mitigation - Challenge suspicious traffic Layer 2: Rate Limiting (Application Layer) - 100 requests/minute per IP - 10,000 requests/hour per user - Exponential backoff for violations Layer 3: Geographic Blocking - Block countries with no customers - Whitelist known good IPs - Challenge new IPs (CAPTCHA) Layer 4: API Authentication - All APIs require valid token - Token rate limits (separate from IP) - Revoke compromised tokens instantly Response Protocol: // Automated DDoS response class DDoSMitigation { async detect() { const metrics = await getMetrics({ period: '1min' }); if (metrics.requestRate > 10000) { // 10K req/sec return true; } if (metrics.errorRate > 0.5) { // 50% errors return true; } return false; } async mitigate() { // 1. Enable "Under Attack" mode (Cloudflare) await cloudflare.setSecurityLevel('under_attack'); // 2. Reduce rate limits aggressively await redis.set('rate_limit', 10); // 10 req/min // 3. Enable CAPTCHA for all requests await enableCAPTCHA(); // 4. Notify team await sendAlert('DDoS attack detected, mitigations active'); } } // Run every 10 seconds setInterval(async () => { const mitigator = new DDoSMitigation(); if (await mitigator.detect()) { await mitigator.mitigate(); } }, 10000); Category B: Economic Shocks B1. Severe Recession (2008-style) Scenario: GDP drops 10%, customers cut budgets Probability: 10% per year Impact: High (revenue decline) Antifragile Strategy: Thesis: Economic downturns create OPPORTUNITIES During recession: ✅ Competitors shut down → Acquire their customers ✅ Talent costs drop → Hire A+ players cheap ✅ Ad costs decrease → Scale marketing aggressively ✅ M&A targets cheap → Acquire complementary businesses ✅ Customers desperate → Sell "survival" packages Playbook: 1. Shift messaging: "Cut costs with AI automation" 2. Introduce recession-proof tier: $99/month (vs $999) 3. Offer extended payment terms (Net 90 vs Net 30) 4. Launch "Survive & Thrive" consulting package 5. Acquire distressed competitors for pennies Financial Preparation: // Recession-proof financial structure const recessionPrep = { cash_reserves: '24 months operating expenses', // vs typical 6 months debt: 'zero', // No debt = no bankruptcy risk fixed_costs: '<30% of revenue', // Mostly variable (contractors) recurring_revenue: '>60%', // Predictable income customer_concentration: '<10% from single client' // Diversified }; // Automatic cost-cutting triggers if (mrr_growth < 0 for 2_consecutive_months) { // 1. Freeze hiring hiring_freeze = true; // 2. Cut non-essential spend marketing_budget *= 0.5; office_perks = 0; // 3. Renegotiate contracts renegotiate_all_vendor_contracts(); // 4. Focus on retention over acquisition shift_to_retention_mode(); } B2. Cryptocurrency Crash Scenario: USDT depegs, BTC drops 80% Probability: 30% per year Impact: Medium (if overexposed) Prevention Protocol: // Treasury exposure limits const cryptoExposure = { max_crypto_percentage: 0.30, // Never more than 30% in crypto stablecoin_limit: 0.20, // 20% max in USDT bitcoin_limit: 0.10, // 10% max in BTC // Hedging strategy hedge: { perpetual_futures: 'Short 10% of USDT holdings', diversification: 'Multiple stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI)', fiat_buffer: 'Always maintain 6 months fiat reserves' } }; // Automatic rebalancing const rebalance = async () => { const portfolio = await getPortfolio(); if (portfolio.crypto_percentage > 0.30) { // Convert excess crypto to fiat const excess = portfolio.crypto_value - (portfolio.total * 0.30); await convertToFiat(excess, 'USD'); } }; // Run daily schedule.daily('09:00', rebalance); Response Protocol: USDT Depeg Event (USDT drops to $0.90): Hour 0-1: Emergency conversion → Convert ALL USDT to USDC or fiat → Accept 10% loss to prevent 100% loss Hour 1-24: Payment system pivot → Disable USDT payments → Offer USDC, ETH, BTC as alternatives → Notify customers of change Week 1: Long-term strategy → Evaluate stablecoin alternatives → Implement multi-stablecoin support → Never rely on single crypto again Category C: Legal/Regulatory Threats C1. Sudden Regulatory Change Scenario: Canada bans AI services without license Probability: 15% over 10 years Impact: Extinction (if caught in one jurisdiction) Prevention Protocol: Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy: Primary Entity: Canada (main operations) Secondary Entity: Estonia (EU e-Residency, easy digital services) Tertiary Entity: Delaware, USA (fundraising, partnerships) Quaternary Entity: Singapore (Asia-Pacific operations) Benefits: - Can relocate operations within 30 days - Jurisdictional arbitrage (operate from friendliest location) - Different entities serve different regions - Legal attacks in one country don't kill entire business Response Protocol: # Day 1: Regulation announced - Consult with lawyers in affected jurisdiction - Evaluate compliance cost vs relocation cost # Day 7: Decision made IF compliance_cost > $500K OR operationally impossible: - Cease operations in that jurisdiction - Migrate customers to entity in different country - Update terms of service - Notify affected users (30-day notice) # Day 30: Migration complete - All customers moved to compliant entity - Affected jurisdiction entity put in dormant status - No ongoing obligations in hostile jurisdiction C2. Patent Troll Lawsuit Scenario: Company claims you're infringing their "AI chat" patent Probability: 40% for successful tech companies Impact: Medium (expensive but survivable) Prevention Protocol: Defense Strategy: 1. Patent Insurance ($50K/year) - Covers legal fees up to $5M - Protects against frivolous lawsuits 2. Prior Art Documentation - Document all innovations with timestamps - Publish technical blog posts (establishes prior art) - Use defensive publications (free patent alternative) 3. Patent Non-Aggression Pacts - Join Open Invention Network - Cross-license with friendly companies - Pledge not to sue open-source projects 4. Legal Reserve Fund - $500K set aside for legal battles - Don't spend on anything else Response Protocol: Patent Troll Lawsuit Filed: Week 1: Assessment → Hire patent attorney ($500/hour) → Evaluate claim validity → Search for prior art (invalidate their patent) Week 4: Strategy decision IF claim is weak: → Fight aggressively → Countersue for frivolous lawsuit → Make it costly for them IF claim is strong: → Negotiate settlement (<$100K) → Cheaper than years of litigation → Design around patent Month 6: Resolution → Either win in court or settle cheap → Document for future reference → Help others fight same troll Category D: Team/Founder Risks D1. Founder Burnout Scenario: You're exhausted, depressed, can't continue Probability: 50% over 10 years Impact: Critical (if no succession plan) Prevention Protocol: Founder Well-Being System: 1. Sustainable Work Schedule - Max 50 hours/week (not 80+) - 2 weeks vacation per quarter - 1 full day off per week (no email/Slack) - 8 hours sleep minimum 2. Mental Health Support - Monthly therapy sessions ($200/month) - Annual retreat (1 week away from business) - Support group (other founders) - Emergency mental health fund ($10K) 3. Delegation Framework - Hire VP of Operations by Year 2 - Transition to CEO role (not doing everything) - Build executive team you trust - Make yourself replaceable 4. Financial Security - Pay yourself fairly ($150K+ salary by Year 2) - Don't sacrifice personal finances - Emergency fund (6 months personal expenses) - Life/disability insurance Response Protocol: Burnout Warning Signs Detected: Immediate (Day 1): → Take 1 week off (no exceptions) → Delegate all urgent tasks to team → Inform board/investors honestly Short-term (Month 1): → Hire executive coach → Reduce work hours to 30/week → Delegate 50% of current responsibilities → Start therapy Long-term (Month 3): → Evaluate if founder role is right fit → Consider transitioning to Chairman role → Hire professional CEO if needed → Prioritize health over business D2. Key Person Dependency Scenario: CTO quits, only person who understands the system Probability: 30% per year (high turnover industry) Impact: High (if knowledge is not documented) Prevention Protocol: // Knowledge Documentation System const knowledgeManagement = { // All code must be understandable code_review: 'Required for all PRs, 2 approvals minimum', documentation: 'Every module has README + architecture doc', onboarding_docs: 'New engineer productive in <7 days', // Cross-training pair_programming: '20% of development time', knowledge_sharing: 'Weekly tech talks (rotate presenters)', bus_factor: 'Minimum 2 people understand each critical system', // Succession planning shadow_roles: 'Every executive has a shadow (successor)', promotion_pipeline: 'Internal candidates for all roles', retention_bonuses: 'Vest over 4 years, lose if leave early' }; Response Protocol: Critical Employee Gives Notice: Day 1: Retain attempt → Counteroffer (20% raise + equity) → Understand reason for leaving → Fix underlying issue if possible Week 1: Knowledge transfer (if leaving) → 2-week minimum notice (negotiate 4 weeks) → Document all systems they own → Record video walkthroughs → Pair with replacement candidate Week 2: Transition → Hire replacement (expedited process) → External consultant as backup → Overlap period (outgoing + incoming) Month 1: Post-departure → Ensure no knowledge gaps → Improve documentation → Reduce future key person risk Category E: Competitive Threats E1. Tech Giant Enters Market Scenario: Google launches competing AI service (free) Probability: 60% over 10 years Impact: Existential (if unprepared) Antifragile Strategy: Thesis: Giants are SLOW, we're FAST Advantages we have: ✅ Personalized service (they're self-service) ✅ Niche expertise (we specialize, they generalize) ✅ Customer relationships (we have names, they have accounts) ✅ Rapid iteration (ship weekly, they ship yearly) ✅ Flexibility (pivot overnight, they need committees) Defensive Moat Building: 1. Network Effects (hardest to replicate) - Build marketplace with both customers + providers - Google can't instantly create a network 2. Proprietary Data (unique training data) - 100,000+ project outcomes in our database - Google has zero domain-specific data 3. Integration Depth (switching costs) - Customers have 50+ integrations with us - Migration to Google = months of work 4. Brand Loyalty (emotional connection) - We know customer's name, history, pain points - Google is faceless corporation 5. Geographic Niches (too small for giants) - Focus on Canadian/regional markets initially - Google won't optimize for niche markets Response Protocol: Google Announces Competing Product: Week 1: Don't panic → Analyze their offering (what do they do better?) → Identify gaps (what are they missing?) → Survey customers (how many would switch?) Month 1: Double down on strengths → Enhance personalization (white-glove service) → Add features Google won't (too niche) → Strengthen relationships (become indispensable) → Price competitively (not a race to bottom) Quarter 1: Pivot if necessary → If losing customers, move upmarket (enterprise) → Or move downmarket (local businesses) → Find segment Google ignores Year 1: Acquisition opportunity? → Google may want to acquire us (easier than competing) → Position for strategic sale ($100M+) → Or survive as niche player (profitable coexistence) E2. Copycat Competitor (Exact Clone) Scenario: Someone copies your entire website/model Probability: 80% if successful Impact: Low (if you have moats) Prevention Protocol: // Legal protections const intellectualProperty = { trademarks: ['Dig|lit', 'Palm ERP', logos], copyrights: ['Website copy', 'marketing materials', 'documentation'], trade_secrets: ['AI training data', 'customer database', 'algorithms'], // Enforcement monitoring: 'Google Alerts for brand mentions', cease_and_desist: 'Template ready for infringers', legal_budget: '$50K/year for IP enforcement' }; // Technical protections const technicalMoats = { proprietary_data: 'Customer data, usage patterns (not replicable)', network_effects: 'Marketplace with both sides (chicken-egg for copycats)', integrations: '50+ partner integrations (years to build)', brand_recognition: 'SEO rank, backlinks, reputation (not copyable)', team_expertise: 'Knowledge in team's heads (can't clone people)' }; Response Protocol: Copycat Discovered: Day 1: Document everything → Screenshot their site → Save source code (if accessible) → Document all similarities Week 1: Legal assessment → Is it trademark infringement? (using our name?) → Is it copyright violation? (copied our exact text?) → Is it just similar concept? (legal but unethical) Week 2: Response strategy IF clear infringement: → Send cease & desist letter → File DMCA takedown (if hosting stolen content) → Threaten lawsuit if necessary IF just similar: → Ignore (validates our model) → Focus on building moats → Outcompete them (we're faster) Month 1: Competitive intelligence → Monitor their progress → Poach their best customers (offer better deal) → Learn from their improvements (copy their good ideas) PART II: CRISIS RESPONSE FRAMEWORK The Crisis Decision Tree INCIDENT DETECTED │ ▼ [SEVERITY ASSESSMENT] │ ┌───┴───┐ ▼ ▼ LOW HIGH │ ▼ [IMPACT SCOPE] │ ┌───┴───┐ ▼ ▼ LOCAL GLOBAL │ ▼ [TIME PRESSURE] │ ┌───┴───┐ ▼ ▼ HOURS MINUTES │ ▼ [RESPONSE PROTOCOL] Crisis Severity Levels P0: Existential (Company-Ending) Definition: Business cannot operate without immediate resolution Examples: Total data loss, payment system down, security breach Response Time: <15 minutes Escalation: CEO notified immediately, all hands on deck Protocol: 1.

ASSESS (Understand scope) - How many customers affected? - What functionality is broken? - Is data at risk? 3. COMMUNICATE (Transparency) - Status page update (within 5 min) - Email to all customers (within 15 min) - Social media post (within 30 min) 4. TRIAGE (Stabilize) - Restore critical path (payments, auth) - Non-critical features can wait - Get to "limping" state (better than dead) 5. RESOLVE (Fix root cause) - Assemble war room (video call) - Assign clear roles (coordinator, investigator, communicator) - Fix issue properly (not band-aid) 6. POST-MORTEM (Learn) - Write incident report (within 48 hours) - Identify root cause - Implement prevention measures - Compensate affected customers P1: Critical (Major Degradation) Definition: Core functionality impaired, customers frustrated Examples: Slow performance, payment delays, intermittent errors Response Time: <1 hour Escalation: On-call engineer, escalate to team lead if unresolved Protocol: 1. Acknowledge issue (update status page) 2. Investigate root cause (logs, metrics, traces) 3. Implement temporary fix (if root cause fix takes >4 hours) 4. Monitor closely (every 15 minutes) 5. Deploy permanent fix within 24 hours 6. Brief post-mortem (internal doc) P2: Important (Non-Critical Feature Down) Definition: Secondary feature broken, workaround available Examples: Email notifications delayed, analytics not updating Response Time: <4 hours Escalation: Assigned to team, fixed in next sprint if complex P3: Minor (Cosmetic or Low-Impact) Definition: Annoyance, doesn't affect core functionality Examples: Typo on website, incorrect tooltip Response Time: <1 week Escalation: Backlog item, prioritized normally Communication Templates Status Page Update (P0 Incident) [INVESTIGATING] Payment Processing Issues - Oct 17, 2025, 14:23 UTC We are currently investigating reports of failed payment transactions.
