Customer support tools 📄 THE MISSING DOCUMENT I'll create ONE MORE CRITICAL DOCUMENT you need: "Production Readiness Checklist" This will be a comprehensive, industry-standard launch checklist covering: ✅ Technical requirements ✅ Security requirements ✅ Legal requirements ✅ Performance requirements ✅ Business requirements Should I create this document now? It will be your final "go/no-go" checklist before launch. It will include: ✅ Pre-launch checklist (100+ items) ✅ Launch day procedures ✅ Post-launch monitoring ✅ Emergency rollback plan ✅ Support escalation procedures
