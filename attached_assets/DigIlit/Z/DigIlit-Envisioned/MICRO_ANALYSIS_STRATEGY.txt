AI Commander Magnification Protocol:

PHASE 1: KNOWLEDGE MICROSCOPY
- gather cpux
- search "requirement specification gap missing"
- digest cpux --deep

PHASE 2: COMPONENT MAGNIFICATION  
- understand "authentication system current state"
- understand "database architecture and models"
- understand "API completeness status"
- understand "deployment requirements"

PHASE 3: GAP CONCEPTION
- nlp "locate all technical gaps in current implementation"
- nlp "understand what database tables are needed"
- nlp "describe complete user authentication flow"
- nlp "explain payment integration requirements"

PHASE 4: REQUIREMENTS GENERATION
- execute "Conceive complete technical requirements from micro-analysis: database schema, auth system, API completion, deployment config"

PHASE 5: EXECUTION
- execute "Generate missing database models and authentication system"
- execute "Complete all incomplete API endpoints"
- execute "Create production deployment pipeline"
- deploy latest
